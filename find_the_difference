You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more
letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

Solution by reading peer solution:
class Solution {
    fun findTheDifference(s: String, t: String): Char {
        var char: Char
        char = ( t.sumOf{it.toInt()} - s.sumOf{it.toInt()} ).toChar()
        return char
    }
}

Peer solution:
class Solution {
    fun findTheDifference(s: String, t: String) = 
      (t.sumOf { it.toInt() } - s.sumOf { it.toInt() }).toChar()
}
it solve by summarizing the integer interpretation each the s and t
find the result of the subtract of t-s and return the char interpretation
of the result of the subtraction
